Go Wave Robot API
Written by Andrew Gerrand <adg@golang.org>

This is a library that will allow you to write Wave Robots in the 
Go Programming Language. 

It is currently in a very sparse state, and lacks almost everything beyond
simply replying to blips. I would like to remedy this, but presently I lack
the time to do so. If anyone wants to contribute, I will gladly accept patches.
